This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Main files written by me are App.js and App.test.js.

To run, you will need

### `export REACT_APP_LASTFM_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>`

in your .bash_profile or .zshrc. Alternatively, you can hardcode the api key into App.js.

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Then:

### `npm start`

To run tests:

### `npm test`
